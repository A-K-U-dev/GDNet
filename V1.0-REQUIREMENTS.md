# Functional Requirements
- [ ] Players shall be able to connect to worlds
  - [ ] Players shall be assigned a unique ID by the world upon a successful connection handshake

- [ ] Players shall be able to disconnect from worlds

- [ ] Players shall (request to) load and sync zones from the server
  - [ ] A player's request to load into a zone shall be denied or approved by the world based on a user defined condition.
  - [ ] A zone that has not been loaded on the world shall be loaded upon request approval
  - [ ] The world shall send a player an approval message to their load zone request to trigger the player to load the zone on their end.

- [ ] Networked entities that do not belong to any zone in a world shall be delegated to an "orphan zone".
- [ ] Networked entities shall be movable between zones by the world only.

- [ ] GDNet shall have a sanitizer that periodically fires to ensure no leftover data such as disconnected players are left in zone or world 

# Non-Functional Requirements

# Security Requirements
- [ ] GDNet shall provide the option to encrypt and decrypt incoming and outgoing messages using fast symmetric encryption techniques.
- [ ] No player shall be able to join a world that does not match the exact zone and scene structure of the world defined on the player's end.


# Events to Possibly Implement
- Zone loaded locally
- Zone unloaded locally
- Player loaded zone
- Player unloaded zone

# Edge Cases to Consider and Handle
- [ ] A new networked entity is created during zone load entity synchronization.
- [ ] A networked entity in the list of entities to be synchronized with a player has been removed during the sync. process.
- [ ] A Player disconnects during zone load and sync.
